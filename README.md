# ðŸš€ Wanderlust â€“ MERN App (DevOps Practice)

A full-stack *MERN application* built and deployed as part of my *DevOps learning journey*.
This project showcases an end-to-end *CI/CD pipeline*, covering integration, containerization, and deployment on Kubernetes.

---

## ðŸ§© CI/CD Overview

* *Continuous Integration (CI):*
  Implemented using *GitHub Actions* to automatically build, test, and package the application on every push or pull request.
  Docker images are built for both frontend and backend and validated before deployment.

* *Continuous Deployment (CD):*
  Successfully pushes images to *Docker Hub* and deploys them to a *Kubernetes cluster* using manifest files.
  Optional *Terraform* templates are included for provisioning cloud infrastructure (EC2) to host the application.
