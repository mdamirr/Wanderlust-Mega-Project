# üöÄ Wanderlust ‚Äì CI/CD Pipeline on AWS EKS  
**End-to-End DevOps Implementation | MERN Stack | AWS | Kubernetes | Jenkins | ArgoCD**

---

## üìñ About the Project  
**Wanderlust** is a full-stack travel blog web app deployed through a complete **CI/CD pipeline** on **AWS EKS (Kubernetes)**.  
The goal was to design a **secure, automated, and scalable DevOps workflow** from code commit to deployment and monitoring.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, ArgoCD  
- **Security:** SonarQube, OWASP, Trivy  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Orchestration:** AWS EKS (Kubernetes)  
- **Caching:** Redis  
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus & Grafana (via Helm)  
- **Automation:** eksctl, AWS CLI

## üß© Implementation Highlights  
- Built and deployed a **3-tier MERN application** using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on AWS.  
- Configured **Jenkins Master‚ÄìSlave architecture** for distributed build execution.  
- Integrated **SonarQube, OWASP**, and **Trivy** for static code analysis and vulnerability scanning.  
- Automated **Docker image build and push** to ECR, ensuring reliable container deployments.  
- Used **ArgoCD (GitOps)** for continuous delivery to AWS **EKS** with version control.  
- Deployed **Prometheus & Grafana** via Helm for real-time monitoring and alerting.  
- Set up **email notifications** in Jenkins for build status and system updates.
